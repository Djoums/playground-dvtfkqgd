# Welcome to the Babel of Languages

`CodinGame` currently supports 27 different programming languages.
This provides us an excellent opportunity to leave the comfort zone of the language we regularly use, and to check out some new stuff!
This `tech.io` article will explore some of the basic characteristics of these programming languages.
We will do this by examining a simple code snippet - sample solutions for the very same puzzle.
It is not meant as full-fledged language tutorial, we can really only scratch the surface.
If you get interested in a language some links are provided for further study.
You are also encouraged to (re)visit some of the practice puzzles on CodinGame and try to solve them in a new language!
Some frustration is guaranteed, but you can also expect some nice 'aha' moments, and some CG achievements.

# The sample puzzle

Throughout this article, I use the easy practice puzzle '[Chuck Norris](https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/chuck-norris)', as the example code, because it is very short, but already includes multiple language constructs. The sample solution is not the shortest, nor the fastest, it serves just as common starting point for comparing the languages.

If you haven't solved this puzzle yet, I highly recommend to try to solve it in your favourite coding language, before continuing with this article. I will not discuss the puzzle itself or how the solution work.
The focus of this article is solely the diversity of the programming languages.
