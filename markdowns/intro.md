# Welcome to the Babel of Languages

**CodinGame** currently supports **27** different programming languages.
This provides us an excellent opportunity to leave the comfort zone of the language we regularly use, and to check out some new stuff!
This `tech.io` article will explore some of the basic characteristics of these programming languages.

We will do this by examining a simple code snippet - sample solutions for the very same puzzle.
It is not meant as full-fledged language tutorial, we can really just scratch the surface in such short time.
If you get interested in a language, some links are provided for further study.

You are also encouraged to (re)visit some of the [practice puzzles](https://www.codingame.com/training) on CodinGame and try to solve them in a new language!
Some frustration is guaranteed, but you can also expect some nice 'aha' moments, and some CG achievements.

## The sample puzzle

Throughout this article, I use the easy practice puzzle '[Chuck Norris](https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/chuck-norris)', as the example code.  It is short, but already includes multiple language constructs. The sample solutions provided are not the shortest, nor the fastest code possible, they serve just as a common starting point for comparing the languages.

If you haven't solved this puzzle yet, _I highly recommend to try to solve it_ in your favourite coding language, before continuing with this article! I will not discuss the puzzle itself, or how the solution work. The focus of this article is solely the diversity of the programming languages. While technicaly you can copy the sample solutions to the puzzle IDE for a quick success of submit, you will miss the learning opportunity by doing so.

Note: In order the code snippets remain runnable in tech.io I commented out the reading input from the standard stream and replaced it with a constant input. For the real puzzle, of course you will need to read the input for the test cases.

## Quick jump to a specific language

The languages in this article are ordered _more or less_ by language popularity. I also did some grouping of similar languages to make the discussion a bit easier to read. I recommend reading it in order, however you can jump to specific part of the article using the direct links below:
