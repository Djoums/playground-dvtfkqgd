# Pascal

Believe it or not, Pascal was in the top 3 languages when I was a teenager. Let's dive in!

## Checking the sample code

...Except, it seems to be unsupported on `tech.io`...\
Which is understandable given that it fell out of the top 100 languages by popularity.

Instead of `Chuck Norris` sample code, let me show you a screenshot from Borland Pascal 7.0, an IDE that was ahead it's time 25+ years ago:

While I knew `Pascal` inside-out, I largely forgotten it, so I will skip going into more details.

## Resources to check

- [Overview on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language))
- Official tutorial: _NO, trust me, no-one is learning to code in Pascal nowadays..._
- But if you insist, you can check out [Free Pascal Compiler](https://www.freepascal.org/docs.html)

## Coming next...

After this short detour, let's continue with a language that really stood the test of time: **C++**!
